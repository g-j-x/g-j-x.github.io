			<p>The IEEE International Workshop on Incomplete
				Streaming Data Analysis (ISDA 2023) will be held in conjunction with the 2023 IEEE
				International Conference on Data Mining (<a href="https://www.cloud-conf.net/icdm2023/" style="text-decoration: none;">ICDM2023</a>)
				on December 1-4, 2023.<br />The
				conference venue is planned to be held in Shanghai, China.However,Due to the ongoing COVID-19 circumstances around
				the world, ICDM 2023 will be a hybird conference. We will consider to change it to be fully on-site or fully
				virtual considering the pandemic situation.</p>

			<h2>Duration</h2>
			<p>Half-Day</p>

			<h2><strong>Scope</strong></h2>
			<p>With the development of super computing and cloud facilities, massive data are generated at every millisecond,
				yielding huge datasets in both laboratory and industry. Rather than storing all the data for post-hoc analysis,
				scientists are turning to the paradigm of streaming data analysis: once the data have been generated or
				encountered, sophisticated analyses will be performed right there and then. In recent years, streaming data
				analyses are highly visible in both machine learning and data science areas and has enjoyed tremendous growth and
				exhibited rapid development at both the theorem and application levels.
				In many real applications, e.g., online spam filtering, ad click prediction, identifying malicious URLs, and
				spatio-temporal signal processing, however, collected streaming data are commonly incomplete due to various
				unpredictable factors, e.g., privacy protection, system breakdown, and human errors. Incomplete streaming data
				analyses has therefore become a challenge dur to the biases and uncertainties caused by the missing information,
				which greatly impairs the learning modelsâ€™ performance.
				Aiming at discussing possible solutions to this problem, this workshop proposes to focus on the main theme of
				incomplete streaming data analysis (ISDA), which is currently emerging as a rapidly growing field of data science
				research. The focus of this workshop is on empirical findings, methodological papers, theoretical underpinnings,
				and conceptual insights related to ISDA.
			</p>
			<h2><strong>Topics</strong></h2>
			<p>This workshop aims at discussing the progress in fundamental principles, practical methodologies, efficient
				implementations, and applications of ISDA. We expect to encourage an exchange of ideas and perceptions through the
				workshop, focusing on novel research directions, techniques, and challenges in the areas of ISDA. We welcome papers
				on topics of interest that include, but are not limited to:</p>
